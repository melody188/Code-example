# Code-example: 
This repo contains two notebooks as a example to show my past coding and project experiences. The file named 
Detect_outlier_ships is substracted from one of my research project to detect abnormal vessels within 6 months
along the east coast. The other one: GBM_example is substracted from an intern project when I was at Adobe last summer.
I was assigned with a project to find the best email sending time for some Adobeâ€™s enterprise level customers,
like Unilever, Microsoft, etc.
